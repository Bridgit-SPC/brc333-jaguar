## Pixel Magic 

### Tulum Jaguar Ordinal Collection 

This Bitcoin ordinal collection is being created as a participatory art experiment using the 
[BRC333](https://github.com/Bridgit-SPC/brc333/tree/main) recursive pixelation protocol that creates smart ordinal art, which is dynamic, interactive, personalized, indexable, and 
reinscribable. 

The first step in our process was deciding on the theme of collection. We decided to go with the jaguar, which is 
the sacred Balam in Mayan culture using as a base a 50x50 pixelated jaguar that was generated by DALLE-3 and 
subsequently modified to fit a true 50x50 canvas.

The next step was learning about ordinals, image-based recursion collections, and dynamic pixel-based recursion 
collections enabled by the [BRC333 protocol](https://github.com/Bridgit-SPC/brc333/tree/main). 

Then then we did a short think tank on what we might do with the collection, decided on some prelimianyr 
directions for traits, and had a short demo of the pixilart.com application. It was emphasized that traits 
should be drawn in distinct colors so that cn run them them through the colorAnalysis script to get the 
coordinates of the trait parts.
